# Traffic Accident Data Analysis

**Insight-driven exploration of traffic accident patterns using data analysis and visualization.**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This notebook (`Task_04.ipynb`) offers a structured analysis of traffic accident data. The focus lies on cleaning, exploring, and visualizing accident records to uncover key trends—such as accident timing, age group involvement, vehicle types, and causes—using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib/Seaborn.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the accident dataset.  
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to study accident frequency, severity, demographics, and vehicle types.  
- Visualize patterns and highlight the most common causes of accidents.
