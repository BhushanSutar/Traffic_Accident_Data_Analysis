# Traffic Accident Data Analysis

**Insight-driven exploration of traffic accident patterns using data analysis and visualization.**

---

##  Project Overview

This notebook (`Task_04.ipynb`) offers a structured analysis of traffic accident data. The focus lies on cleaning, exploring, and visualizing accident records to unearth key trends—such as accident types, temporal patterns, and contributing conditions—using tools like Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib/Seaborn.

---

##  Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the raw accident dataset.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand:
  - Time-based trends (e.g., monthly or yearly patterns)
  - Accident severity breakdowns
  - Correlations with factors like weather, lighting, or road conditions
- Visualize insights through clear charts and plots.

##  Key Insights (Examples)
*(Customize based on your actual findings)*

- **Seasonality**: Accident frequency peaks in [Month(s)].
- **Severity Distribution**: Proportion of accidents categorized as *Fatal / Serious / Minor*.
- **Environmental Impact**: Higher accident counts observed under **[weather condition, e.g., rain]** or low-light scenarios.
- **Time of Day Trends**: Most accidents occur during **[e.g., evening rush hours]**.
